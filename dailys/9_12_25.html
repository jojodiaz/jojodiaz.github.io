    <h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>
      Day 1. Day 1 of what? Day 1 of learning something every day, silly!  
      Writing this in <code>vim</code>. Man. What a pain. Now don’t get me wrong —
      I love the gushing feeling of elitism you get when you write something in vim,  
      but let’s be honest: most development goes way faster when you drop the
      pretentiousness and use VS Code like a normal person.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the point of these daily notes is to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Develop proficiency in tools I find cool/important</li>
      <li>Have a written record of my growth as an engineer and as a person</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Suffering through vim is just one step of the process. It feels right.
      So I created my <code>.vimrc</code> today with some small but insanely
      important commands:
    </p>

    <pre><code>set tabstop=4
set number=on
syntax on</code></pre>

    <p>
      The next thing I want to do is make the styling for this page a separate CSS file.
      Modularity and all. But boy, do I feel negatively about <em>already</em> refactoring code.
      Yes, I understand technical debt build-up, but in true engineering fashion I am simply
      writing more and more code on top of it all.
    </p>

    <p>
      But now I’m thinking of the recruiters that might read some of these pages.  
      ****. ****! Fine, my next steps will be to beautify… AND modularize my crappy code. Blegh.
